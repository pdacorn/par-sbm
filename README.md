#Parallel Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models (Par-SBM)
Version 0.1

This program is to identify non-overlapping communities for undirected networks. It provides good solutions for the input graphs that fit the stochastic block models (SBMs). Comparing with non-model based algorithms, it can provide a meaningful alternative solution for general input graphs. Comparing with other SBM-based algorithms, it runs faster on one processor and is more scalable on multi-processor systems. 

A serial matlab implementation is available in the "Serial Version in Matlab" folder.
